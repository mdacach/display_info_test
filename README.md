# display_info_test
This is a simple script demonstrating the issue I've had with [screenshots crate](https://crates.io/crates/screenshots).

 I've tracked the issue up to [display-info crate](https://crates.io/crates/display-info/0.1.1)
and created an [issue](https://github.com/nashaofu/display-info/issues/1) there.
